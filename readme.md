My personal website, partially used as a resume, partially used as a place for me to upload things I like.

### Roadmap

- improve local time and weather selector, currently does not seem to bring in the correct time

- add contact me section

- improve language selector, currently only seems to update when it feels like it and only certain parts of the site

- port whole site to react and tailwind css as my js and css files are too enormous to handle currently
